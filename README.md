# Description

This project serves the purpose of deploying a Spring Boot application using AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) for
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) following best practice AWS architecture n-tier.

What this project offers is hands-on knowledge about getting a Spring Boot application into the cloud and operating it
there. I built a continuous deployment pipeline, accessed the most common AWS services from a Spring Boot app, and
learned how to monitor and nurture the app once it‚Äôs live.

# Introduction

In this project, we leverage AWS CDK to provision and manage AWS resources needed to deploy a Spring Boot application.
The primary goal is to demonstrate how to use AWS services in a structured and automated manner, ensuring scalability,
reliability, and maintainability.

## Architecture Overview

This project follows an n-tier architecture which includes:

- **Presentation Tier**: This layer is the endpoint for requests from clients.
- **Application Tier**: Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) for running the Spring Boot application in Docker
  containers.
- **Data Tier**: Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) for database management.
- **Networking**: Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) for networking and security.

## Pre-requisites

- AWS CLI
- Node.js (for AWS CDK)
- AWS CDK Toolkit
- Docker
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven or Gradle (for building the Spring Boot application)

## AWS Services

This is all AWS services will be leveraged in this project. For more detail, I recommend reading them on AWS Official
