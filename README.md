# Description

This project serves the purpose of deploying a Spring Boot application using AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) for
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) following best practice AWS architecture n-tier.

What this project offers is hands-on knowledge about getting a Spring Boot application into the cloud and operating it
there. I built a continuous deployment pipeline, accessed the most common AWS services from a Spring Boot app, and
learned how to monitor and nurture the app once it‚Äôs live.

The Spring Boot application used for deploying is at this [repo](https://github.com/Bistro-Cheese/cheese-bistro-server)

# Introduction

In this project, we leverage AWS CDK to provision and manage AWS resources needed to deploy a Spring Boot application.
The primary goal is to demonstrate how to use AWS services in a structured and automated manner, ensuring scalability,
reliability, and maintainability.



## Architecture Overview

This project follows an n-tier architecture which includes:

- **Presentation Tier**: This layer is the endpoint for requests from clients.
- **Application Tier**: Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) for running the Spring Boot application in Docker
  containers.
- **Data Tier**: Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) for database management.
- **Networking**: Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) for networking and security.

## Pre-requisites

- AWS CLI
  - You must configure security credentials for the CDK CLI, refer to this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/configure-access.html)
- Node.js (for AWS CDK)
- AWS CDK Toolkit
- Docker
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven

## AWS Services

This is all AWS services will be leveraged in this project. For more detail, I recommend reading them on AWS Official

# Getting Started
- For setting up AWS CDK, please refer to this [AWS Document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html)
- Make sure that you follow step by step to install all essential tools, packages, and configuration. Let's go to the usage.
# Usage
Because I have not built CI/CD for this project so if you want to deploy services, you must deploy each one.
Variable Meaning:
- `--profile bistroadmin`: AWS CLI profile to use.
- `--app "mvn -e -q compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.myorg.<JAVA_CLASS>"`: Command to compile and execute the CDK app.
- `-c region=<your_region>`: AWS region for deployment.
- `-c applicationName=<your_app_name>`: Name of the application.
- `-c springProfile=<spring_profile>`: Spring Boot profile to use.
- `-c environmentName=<your_environment>`: Deployment environment name.
- `-c dockerRepositoryName=<ecr_repo>`: Name of the Docker repository.
- `-c dockerImageTag=<img_tag>`: Tag for the Docker image.

In the source, you must come to the directory `src/main/java/com/myorg/constant/AWSParameter.java`, then replacing `ACCOUNT_ID` with your AWS account id.

Now opening your cmd at where the directory contains CDK source code and executing respectively below command.

**Network Service**:
```sh
cdk deploy --app "mvn -e -q compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.myorg.NetworkApp" --profile <your_profile> -c region=<your_region> -c environmentName=<your_environment>
```
**Docker Repository**:
```sh
cdk deploy --app "mvn -e -q compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.myorg.DockerRepositoryApp" --profile <your_profile> -c region=<your_region> -c environmentName=<your_environment>
```
**Database - RDS**:
```sh
cdk deploy --app "mvn -e -q compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.myorg.DatabaseApp" --profile <your_profile> -c region=<your_region> -c environmentName=<your_environment>
```
**Queue**:

```sh
cdk deploy --app "mvn -e -q compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.myorg.MessagingApp" --profile <your_profile> -c region=<your_region> -c environmentName=<your_environment>
```

**Your Service**:
```sh
cdk deploy --profile bistroadmin --app "mvn -e -q compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.myorg.ServiceApp"  --profile <your_profile> -c region=<your_region> -c applicationName=<your_app_name> -c springProfile=<spring_profile> -c environmentName=<your_environment> -c dockerRepositoryName=<ecr_repo> -c dockerImageTag=<img_tag> --all
```
